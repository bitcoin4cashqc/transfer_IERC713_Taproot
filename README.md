Here's a Node.js script using web3.js to call the transferOwnership function on a smart contract implementing the IERC173 interface. This script assumes you have access to your private key for signing the transaction.

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have web3 installed in your project. If not, install it using:

bash npm install web3

Replace Placeholders:

Replace https://your-scroll-mainnet-rpc-url with the actual Scroll mainnet RPC URL. Replace 0xYourContractAddress with the address of your contract. Replace 0xYourPrivateKey with the private key of the owner account (keep it secure). Replace 0xYourOwnerAddress with the owner's wallet address. Replace 0xNewOwnerAddress with the address of the new owner.

bash node transferOwnership.js

Check the Transaction: The script will log the transaction hash. Use it to verify the transaction on a Scroll block explorer.
